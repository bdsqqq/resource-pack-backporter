# Conditional Compiler Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-06-05T12:04:57+0000  
**Context:** Resource Pack Backporter - Conditional Compiler Architecture Implementation  
**Status:** Major architecture rewrite completed, bugs still present

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Complete Architecture Rewrite
- **Replaced Strategy Pattern** with Conditional Compiler approach
- **Created new system**: `src/conditional-compiler/` with 3 main components:
  - `ConditionalPathExtractor` - Parses nested `minecraft:select` and `minecraft:condition` structures
  - `TargetSystemMapper` - Converts execution paths to output targets (Pommel, CIT, 3D models)
  - `BackportFileGenerator` - Generates multiple output files with deduplication

### ‚úÖ Fixed Major Architectural Issues
1. **Discovered root cause**: CIT properties without context restrictions override ALL display contexts
2. **Implemented correct pattern**: CIT points to individual enchantment model files that contain Pommel overrides
3. **Added proper texture naming**: 
   - Single-level enchantments: `channeling.png` (no level suffix)
   - Multi-level enchantments: `bane_of_arthropods_1.png` (with level suffix)
4. **Fixed name mappings**: `binding_curse` ‚Üí `curse_of_binding`, `vanishing_curse` ‚Üí `curse_of_vanishing`

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Feature Support
- **Added `minecraft:condition` support** for writable_book conditional structures
- **Fixed non-enchanted books** - now generate Pommel overrides for regular books
- **Added missing ground predicates** - all enchantment models now have `pommel:is_ground`

## Current Mental Model

### The Correct Architecture Pattern:
```
1. Regular Books (book.json, writable_book.json):
   - Base texture + Pommel overrides directly
   - No CIT properties needed

2. Enchanted Books:
   - Base model (enchanted_book.json): Simple, no overrides
   - CIT properties: Point to individual enchantment models
   - Individual models (channeling_1.json): Base texture + Pommel overrides
   - 3D models: Copied from source with animations preserved
```

### Key Understanding - Why Curse of Binding Worked:
- **Correct texture name**: `curse_of_binding.png` (matches expected pattern)
- **Complete predicate set**: Had all three predicates (ground, held, offhand)
- **Single model pattern**: Less prone to path resolution issues

## Current Status - Bugs Still Present

### üî¥ **Main Hand Invisibility** - STILL BROKEN
- Books show correctly in GUI and offhand
- Books invisible when held in main hand
- **Breakthrough**: Curse of binding works correctly in all contexts

### üî¥ **Single-Level Enchantments** - PARTIALLY FIXED
- Fixed pink/black squares by implementing proper texture naming
- Fixed curse enchantment name mappings
- **Need to verify**: All single-level enchantments now work

## Critical Execution Information

### **Script Execution Command:**
```bash
bun run ./src './temp/Better Fresher 3D Books v1.2'
```

### **Copy to Minecraft Command:**
```bash
cp -r ./dist/‚Ü∫--enchanting_in_a_new_dimension '/Users/bdsqqq/Library/Application Support/ModrinthApp/profiles/Fabulously Optimized (1)/resourcepacks'
```

### **Key Files to Compare:**
- **Reference working**: `temp/reference_backported_books_pack/assets/minecraft/models/item/enchanted_books/`
- **Our output**: `dist/‚Ü∫--enchanting_in_a_new_dimension/assets/minecraft/models/item/enchanted_books/`
- **Source pack**: `temp/Better Fresher 3D Books v1.2/`

## Next Steps - Critical Investigation Path

### üîç **1. Analyze Curse of Binding vs Others (HIGH PRIORITY)**
The fact that curse of binding works perfectly while others don't suggests a **model path resolution issue**:

```bash
# Compare working vs broken:
diff temp/reference_backported_books_pack/assets/minecraft/models/item/enchanted_books/binding_curse_1.json \
     dist/‚Ü∫--enchanting_in_a_new_dimension/assets/minecraft/models/item/enchanted_books/binding_curse_1.json

# Check 3D model paths exist:
ls dist/‚Ü∫--enchanting_in_a_new_dimension/assets/minecraft/models/item/books_3d/curse_of_binding_3d_open.json
ls dist/‚Ü∫--enchanting_in_a_new_dimension/assets/minecraft/models/item/books_3d/channeling_3d_open.json
```

### üîç **2. Investigate 3D Model Path Issues**
**Theory**: The 3D model paths in Pommel overrides might be incorrect or files missing:
- Check if `minecraft:item/books_3d/channeling_3d_open` exists
- Verify path format: `minecraft:item/` vs `assets/minecraft/models/item/`
- Compare exact model reference patterns

### üîç **3. Debug Pommel Predicate Processing**
**Theory**: Pommel predicates might conflict or have incorrect priority:
- Check for duplicate `pommel:is_held` predicates in generated models
- Verify predicate format matches reference exactly
- Test simplified model with only main hand predicate

### üîç **4. Validate CIT Property Functionality**
Ensure CIT properties are actually being applied:
```bash
# Check CIT property format matches reference exactly:
diff temp/reference_backported_books_pack/assets/minecraft/optifine/cit/channeling_1.properties \
     dist/‚Ü∫--enchanting_in_a_new_dimension/assets/minecraft/optifine/cit/channeling_1.properties
```

## Key Findings to Remember

1. **Architecture is fundamentally correct now** - the conditional compiler approach matches the reference pattern
2. **Texture naming fixed** - pink/black squares should be resolved
3. **Ground predicates added** - books should work on ground
4. **The fact curse of binding works proves the system CAN work** - it's a specific path/reference issue

## Code Locations

- **Main coordinator**: `src/conditional-compiler/backport-coordinator.ts`
- **Path extraction**: `src/conditional-compiler/path-extractor.ts`
- **Target mapping**: `src/conditional-compiler/target-mapper.ts` 
- **File generation**: `src/conditional-compiler/file-generator.ts`
- **Entry point**: `src/index.ts` (updated to use new coordinator)

## Success Criteria (Unchanged)

- ‚úÖ Books visible in main hand
- ‚úÖ Preserved animations on enchanted books  
- ‚úÖ No duplicate Pommel predicates
- ‚úÖ Working CIT functionality for GUI sprites
- ‚úÖ Output matching reference pack exactly
