# Predicate Test Pack Instructions

## What to Test:

### 1. Test book_test_lefthanded.json
- Rename it to book.json temporarily
- Should show different colors based on left/right-handed setting
- Red = left-handed players, Green = right-handed players

### 2. Test book_test_custom_model_data.json  
- Rename it to book.json temporarily
- Use commands:
  /give @p minecraft:book{CustomModelData:1} (should be red)
  /give @p minecraft:book{CustomModelData:2} (should be green)
  /give @p minecraft:book{CustomModelData:3} (should be blue)

### 3. Test book_test_damaged.json
- Rename it to book.json temporarily  
- Get damaged vs undamaged books (books don't usually have durability though)

## Results:
- Note which predicates actually work
- CustomModelData should definitely work
- lefthanded and damaged are questionable

## Current Working Predicates in 1.21.1:
✅ custom_model_data
❓ lefthanded  
❓ damaged
❓ Others unknown
