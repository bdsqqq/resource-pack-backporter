# CustomModelData Debug Tests

## Test 1: Red Wool Texture (should definitely work)
/give @p minecraft:enchanted_book[minecraft:custom_model_data=1]

## Test 2: 3D Enchanted Book Model  
/give @p minecraft:enchanted_book[minecraft:custom_model_data=2]

## Test 3: Specific Aqua Affinity Model
/give @p minecraft:enchanted_book[minecraft:custom_model_data=3]

## What to expect:
- CMD 1: Red block texture (proves CustomModelData works)
- CMD 2: 3D enchanted book model
- CMD 3: Specific aqua affinity model

## If CMD 1 doesn't work:
- CustomModelData system is broken
- Check resource pack is enabled and reloaded

## If CMD 1 works but 2/3 don't:
- Model paths are wrong
- 3D models have issues
