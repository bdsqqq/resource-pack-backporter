**Avoid Over-Architecture - Embrace Moderate Complexity Solutions**

When facing complex problems, resist jumping to elaborate architectural solutions. The resource pack backporter issue appeared to need a "Conditional Decomposition Compiler" with AST parsing and multi-target compilation, but the actual fix was just:

1. **One-line model copy fix** - Remove unnecessary filtering
2. **30-line handler enhancement** - Add missing Pommel model generation

The existing Strategy Pattern architecture was sound - it just needed better handler implementations, not fundamental redesign. 

**Actionable principle**: Between "simple bug fix" and "complete rewrite" lies the sweet spot of moderate complexity solutions. Before designing complex systems, verify if the current architecture can be improved with targeted enhancements rather than replaced entirely.

**Application**: When debugging shows missing functionality, first check if existing patterns can be extended before creating new architectural layers.
